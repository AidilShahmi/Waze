# **Waze Project**
**Course 2 - Get Started with Python**

Welcome to the Waze Project!

Your Waze data analytics team is still in the early stages of their user churn project. Previously, you were asked to complete a project proposal by your supervisor, May Santner. You have received notice that your project proposal has been approved and that your team has been given access to Waze's user data. To get clear insights, the user data must be inspected and prepared for the upcoming process of exploratory data analysis (EDA).

A Python notebook has been prepared to guide you through this project. Answer the questions and create an executive summary for the Waze data team.

# **Course 2 End-of-course project: Inspect and analyze data**

In this activity, you will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis. This activity will help ensure the information is,

1.   Ready to answer questions and yield insights

2.   Ready for visualizations

3.   Ready for future hypothesis testing and statistical methods
<br/>

**The purpose** of this project is to investigate and understand the data provided.

**The goal** is to use a dataframe contructed within Python, perform a cursory inspection of the provided dataset, and inform team members of your findings.
<br/>

*This activity has three parts:*

**Part 1:** Understand the situation
* How can you best prepare to understand and organize the provided information?

**Part 2:** Understand the data

* Create a pandas dataframe for data learning, future exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical activities

* Compile summary information about the data to inform next steps

**Part 3:** Understand the variables

* Use insights from your examination of the summary data to guide deeper investigation into variables


<br/>

Follow the instructions and answer the following questions to complete the activity. Then, you will complete an Executive Summary using the questions listed on the PACE Strategy Document.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

# **PACE stages**


Throughout these project notebooks, you'll see references to the problem-solving framework PACE. The following notebook components are labeled with the respective PACE stage: Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute.

<img src="images/Plan.png" width="100" height="100" align=left>


## **PACE: Plan**

Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document and those below to craft your response:

### **Task 1. Understand the situation**

*   How can you best prepare to understand and organize the provided driver data?


*Begin by exploring your dataset and consider reviewing the Data Dictionary.*

**Answer:**

Prepare by reading in the data, viewing the data dictionary, and exploring the dataset to identify key variables for the stakeholder.

<img src="images/Analyze.png" width="100" height="100" align=left>

## **PACE: Analyze**

Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document to reflect on the Analyze stage.

### **Task 2a. Imports and data loading**

Start by importing the packages that you will need to load and explore the dataset. Make sure to use the following import statements:

*   `import pandas as pd`

*   `import numpy as np`

# Import packages for data manipulation
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

Then, load the dataset into a dataframe. Creating a dataframe will help you conduct data manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical activities.

**Note:** As shown in this cell, the dataset has been automatically loaded in for you. You do not need to download the .csv file, or provide more code, in order to access the dataset and proceed with this lab. Please continue with this activity by completing the following instructions.


# Load dataset into dataframe
df = pd.read_csv('waze_dataset.csv')

### **Task 2b. Summary information**

View and inspect summary information about the dataframe by **coding the following:**

1.   df.head(10)
2.   df.info()

*Consider the following questions:*

1. When reviewing the `df.head()` output, are there any variables that have missing values?

2. When reviewing the `df.info()` output, what are the data types? How many rows and columns do you have?

3. Does the dataset have any missing values?

**Answers:**

1. None of the variables in the first 10 observations have missing values. Note that this does not imply the whole dataset does not have any missing values.

2. The variables `label` and `device` are of type `object`; `total_sessions`, `driven_km_drives`, and `duration_minutes_drives` are of type `float64`; the rest of the variables are of type `int64`. There are 14,999 rows and 13 columns.

3. The dataset has 700 missing values in the `label` column.

### **Task 2c. Null values and summary statistics**

Compare the summary statistics of the 700 rows that are missing labels with summary statistics of the rows that are not missing any values.

**Question:** Is there a discernible difference between the two populations?

**Answer:**

> Comparing summary statistics of the observations with missing retention labels with those that aren't missing any values reveals nothing remarkable. The means and standard deviations are fairly consistent between the two groups.

### **Task 2d. Null values - device counts**

Next, check the two populations with respect to the `device` variable.

**Question:** How many iPhone users had null values and how many Android users had null values?

# Get count of null values by device
null_df['device'].value_counts()

iPhone     447
Android    253
Name: device, dtype: int64

**Answer:**
> Of the 700 rows with null values, 447 were iPhone users and 253 were Android users.

Now, of the rows with null values, calculate the percentage with each device&mdash;Android and iPhone. You can do this directly with the [`value_counts()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html) function.

# Calculate % of iPhone nulls and Android nulls
null_df['device'].value_counts(normalize=True)

Phone     0.638571
Android    0.361429
Name: device, dtype: float64

How does this compare to the device ratio in the full dataset?

# Calculate % of iPhone users and Android users in full dataset
df['device'].value_counts(normalize=True)

iPhone     0.644843
Android    0.355157
Name: device, dtype: float64

The percentage of missing values by each device is consistent with their representation in the data overall.

There is nothing to suggest a non-random cause of the missing data.

Examine the counts and percentages of users who churned vs. those who were retained. How many of each group are represented in the data?

# Calculate counts of churned vs. retained
print(df['label'].value_counts())
print()
print(df['label'].value_counts(normalize=True))

retained    11763
churned      2536
Name: label, dtype: int64

retained    0.822645
churned     0.177355
Name: label, dtype: float64

This dataset contains 82% retained users and 18% churned users.

Next, compare the medians of each variable for churned and retained users. The reason for calculating the median and not the mean is that you don't want outliers to unduly affect the portrayal of a typical user. Notice, for example, that the maximum value in the `driven_km_drives` column is 21,183 km. That's more than half the circumference of the earth!

# Calculate median values of all columns for churned and retained users
df.groupby('label').median(numeric_only=True)

ID	sessions	drives	total_sessions	n_days_after_onboarding	total_navigations_fav1	total_navigations_fav2	driven_km_drives	duration_minutes_drives	activity_days	driving_days
label											
churned	7477.5	59.0	50.0	164.339042	1321.0	84.5	11.0	3652.655666	1607.183785	8.0	6.0
retained	7509.0	56.0	47.0	157.586756	1843.0	68.0	9.0	3464.684614	1458.046141	17.0	14.0

This offers an interesting snapshot of the two groups, churned vs. retained:

Users who churned averaged ~3 more drives in the last month than retained users, but retained users used the app on over twice as many days as churned users in the same time period.

The median churned user drove ~200 more kilometers and 2.5 more hours during the last month than the median retained user.

It seems that churned users had more drives in fewer days, and their trips were farther and longer in duration. Perhaps this is suggestive of a user profile. Continue exploring!



Calculate the median kilometers per drive in the last month for both retained and churned users.

# Group data by `label` and calculate the medians
medians_by_label = df.groupby('label').median(numeric_only=True)
print('Median kilometers per drive:')
# Divide the median distance by median number of drives
medians_by_label['driven_km_drives'] / medians_by_label['drives']

Median kilometers per drive:
label
churned     73.053113
retained    73.716694
dtype: float64

The median user from both groups drove ~73 km/drive. How many kilometers per driving day was this?

# Divide the median distance by median number of driving days
print('Median kilometers per driving day:')
medians_by_label['driven_km_drives'] / medians_by_label['driving_days']

Median kilometers per driving day:
label
churned     608.775944
retained    247.477472
dtype: float64

Now, calculate the median number of drives per driving day for each group.

# Divide the median number of drives by median number of driving days
print('Median drives per driving day:')
medians_by_label['drives'] / medians_by_label['driving_days']

Median drives per driving day:
label
churned     8.333333
retained    3.357143
dtype: float64

The median user who churned drove 608 kilometers each day they drove last month, which is almost 250% the per-drive-day distance of retained users. The median churned user had a similarly disproporionate number of drives per drive day compared to retained users.

It is clear from these figures that, regardless of whether a user churned or not, the users represented in this data are serious drivers! It would probably be safe to assume that this data does not represent typical drivers at large. Perhaps the data&mdash;and in particular the sample of churned users&mdash;contains a high proportion of long-haul truckers.

In consideration of how much these users drive, it would be worthwhile to recommend to Waze that they gather more data on these super-drivers. It's possible that the reason for their driving so much is also the reason why the Waze app does not meet their specific set of needs, which may differ from the needs of a more typical driver, such as a commuter.

Finally, examine whether there is an imbalance in how many users churned by device type.

Begin by getting the overall counts of each device type for each group, churned and retained.

# For each label, calculate the number of Android users and iPhone users
df.groupby(['label', 'device']).size()

label     device 
churned   Android     891
          iPhone     1645
retained  Android    4183
          iPhone     7580
dtype: int64

Now, within each group, churned and retained, calculate what percent was Android and what percent was iPhone.

# For each label, calculate the percentage of Android users and iPhone users
df.groupby('label')['device'].value_counts(normalize=True)

label     device 
churned   iPhone     0.648659
          Android    0.351341
retained  iPhone     0.644393
          Android    0.355607
Name: device, dtype: float64

The ratio of iPhone users and Android users is consistent between the churned group and the retained group, and those ratios are both consistent with the ratio found in the overall dataset.

## **PACE: Execute**

Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document and those below to craft your response:


### **Task 3. Conclusion**

Recall that your supervisor, May Santer, asked you to share your findings with the data team in an executive summary. Consider the following questions as you prepare to write your summary. Think about key points you may want to share with the team, and what information is most relevant to the user churn project.

**Questions:**

1. Did the data contain any missing values? How many, and which variables were affected? Was there a pattern to the missing data?

> *The dataset has 700 missing values in the `label` column. There was no obvious pattern to the missing values.*

2. What is a benefit of using the median value of a sample instead of the mean?

> *Mean is subject to the influence of outliers, while the median represents the middle value of the distribution regardless of any outlying values.*

3. Did your investigation give rise to further questions that you would like to explore or ask the Waze team about?

> *Yes. For example, the median user who churned drove 608 kilometers each day they drove last month, which is almost 250% the per-drive-day distance of retained users. It would be helpful to know how this data was collected and if it represents a non-random sample of users.*

4. What percentage of the users in the dataset were Android users and what percentage were iPhone users?

> *Android users comprised approximately 36% of the sample, while iPhone users made up about 64%*

5. What were some distinguishing characteristics of users who churned vs. users who were retained?

> *Generally, users who churned drove farther and longer in fewer days than retained users. They also used the app about half as many times as retained users over the same period.*

6. Was there an appreciable difference in churn rate between iPhone users vs. Android users?

> *No. The churn rate for both iPhone and Android users was within one percentage point of each other. There is nothing suggestive of churn being correlated with device.*
